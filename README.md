# Possibilities-Tree
This is java implementation for the tree in the pic. In this tree, each Node is a vector of integers of certain length (m), and each index of that vector will have a Vector child of size(m-1) ..So the whole vector will have vector children equal to its length. and so on.  This implementation is missing value insertion in each vector node.
